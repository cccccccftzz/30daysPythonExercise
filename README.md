# Fang Ting's 30++ Days of Python Learning Journey Repository! ðŸš€

## Introduction

Greetings, Python enthusiasts! I'm Fang Ting, a Structural Engineer based in Singapore. 

With almost a decade of experience in structural engineering and a foundational understanding of the C language from my university days, I hope to incorporate Python scripts to enhance modeling efficiency in my structural engineering work, eg. interact with ETABS, PLAXIS, etc. 

If you're a fellow beginner, you're in good company as we navigate the exciting challenges of learning Python together!

## Repository Content 

**Reference Repository:** I follow [Asabeneh's 30-Days-Of-Python program](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) day by day.

**Illustrations and Understandings:** I'll provide detailed illustrations alongside my personal understanding of each concept.

**Script Exercises and Mistakes:** My script for each session's exercises, accompanied by some mistakes I made along the way. Learning from mistakes and recording them down are the most essential parts of the learning journey!

Happy coding! ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
